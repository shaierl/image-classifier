# image-classifier
An implementation of the method described in the paper [An Analysis of Single-Layer Networks in Unsupervised Feature Learning](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v15/coates11a/coates11a.pdf) by Adam Coates, Homglak Lee and Andrew Y. Ng.

This implementation uses K-means for unsupervised learning and linear SVM for classification.
